# Parking-space-monitoring-system
###Project Overview 🗂️

🅿️ This project is a simple parking monitoring system that uses two PIR (Passive Infrared) sensors to detect vehicles entering and exiting a parking lot with two available spaces. The system displays availability using two LEDs: a green LED for available spaces and a red LED when the parking is full.

⚠️For a better understanding of the project, please read the documentation (I note that it is written in Romanian)❗❗
