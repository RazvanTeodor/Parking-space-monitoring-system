# Parking-space-monitoring-system
🗂️###Project Overview
🅿️ This project is a simple parking monitoring system that uses two PIR (Passive Infrared) sensors to detect vehicles entering and exiting a parking lot with two available spaces. The system displays availability using two LEDs: a green LED for available spaces and a red LED when the parking is full.
